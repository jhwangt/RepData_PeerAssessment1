```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, cache=TRUE)
```

##Loading and preprocessing the data
Code needed to load the data (i.e. 𝚛𝚎𝚊𝚍.𝚌𝚜𝚟())

```{r loading data}
data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

##What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

For this part of the assignment, we ignore the missing values in the dataset.

Calculate the total number of steps taken per day and displayed in a histogram
```{r total}
library(ggplot2)
total.steps <- tapply(data$steps, data$date, FUN=sum, na.rm=TRUE)
qplot(total.steps, binwidth=1000, xlab="Total Number of Steps Taken Each Day")
```

Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day

```{r mean}
mean(total.steps, na.rm=TRUE)
median(total.steps, na.rm=TRUE)
```

##What is the average daily activity pattern?

Make a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
averages <- aggregate(x=list(steps=data$steps), by=list(interval=data$interval),
                      FUN=mean, na.rm=TRUE)
ggplot(data=averages, aes(x=interval, y=steps)) +
    geom_line() +
    xlab("5-minute interval") +
    ylab("average number of steps taken")
```


On average across all the days in the dataset, the 5-minute interval contains the maximum number of steps is below:
```{r}
averages[which.max(averages$steps),]
```


##Imputing missing values

Note that there are a number of days/intervals where there are missing values (coded as 𝙽𝙰). The presence of missing days may introduce bias into some calculations or summaries of the data.

Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with 𝙽𝙰s)
```{r calculate and report total number of missing values}
sum(is.na(data))
```
The strategy we use here are the mean for that 5-minute interval. 

Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.
```{r Creating the new dataset that is equal to the original but with the missing data filled in}
data.merged <- merge(data,averages, by="interval")
data.merged$steps.x[is.na(data.merged$steps.x)] <- data.merged$steps.y[is.na(data.merged$steps.x)]

```


Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. 

```{r Historgram}
data.merged <- aggregate(steps.x~interval,data.merged,sum)
hist(data.merged$steps.x, xlab="Total Steps by Day", ylab="Frequency [Days]",main="Histogram: Number of Daily Steps")
```
The values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment.  We recaculate the mean and median total number of steps taken per day.  

```{r}

mean2 <- mean(data.merged$steps, na.rm=TRUE)
median2 <- median(data.merged$steps, na.rm=TRUE)
```

The impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps are as followed:
1.   The histogram now has many more in the bins values less than 2000 steps per day - the distribution of the new histogram has changed. 
2.   The mean and median went from more than 10000 to less than 3000. Replacing the NA values for the 5-mintues average steps changed resulting analysis.

##Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

For this part, we use the the 𝚠𝚎𝚎𝚔𝚍𝚊𝚢𝚜() function.

Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

```{r}
daytype <- function(date) {
    if (weekdays(as.Date(date)) %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday")) {
        "Weekend"
    } else {
        "Weekday"
    }
}
data$daytype <- as.factor(sapply(data$date, daytype))
str(data)
```

Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). See the README file in the GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot should look like using simulated data.

```{r }
par(mfrow=c(2,1))
for (type in c("Weekend", "Weekday")) {
    steps.type <- aggregate(steps ~ interval,
                            data=data,
                            subset=data$daytype==type,
                            FUN=mean)
    plot(steps.type, type="l", main=type)
}
```
